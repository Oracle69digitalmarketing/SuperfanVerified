Great question 👌

Since your frontend already has a README, we’ll place this new README.md inside your backend root folder (where app.js, models/, routes/ live). That way:

Judges/devs see frontend README when opening that repo.

Backend has its own README with setup + .env instructions.

Both repos stay clean and self-explanatory.

Here’s the backend README draft:


---

🚀 Superfan Backend

Backend service for Superfan Verified — powered by XION + zkTLS + Spotify OAuth.
Handles authentication, proof generation, and persistence for fan verification.


---

📦 Tech Stack

Node.js + Express — REST API

MongoDB + Mongoose — user + fan data persistence

Passport.js — multi-provider auth (Spotify integrated)

zkTLS (Reclaim Protocol) — verifiable internet data proofs

XION SDK — on-chain transactions on testnet

Redis (optional) — caching + session optimization
